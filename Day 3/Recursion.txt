1. recursion is technique in which you call function inside a function
2. every recursive function contains a base condition who's job is to terminate the infinite loop.
3. how to trace a recursive function - they are traced in a tree manner
 ref to first.cpp

funt(3)
/     \
3   funt(2)
    /     \
    2   funt(1)
        /     \
        1   funt(0)

opt: 3 2 1

 ref to understandingRecursionSecond.cpp

            fun2(3)
            /     \
        fun2(2)    3
        /     \
    fun2(1)    2
    /     \
fun2(0)    1

these are called the tree of tracking of recursive function

4. if the statements are writting after the recursive call then the output will be given when going back the tree and vice versa
